  # a volume to mount for writing data to. This can be a PVC or a hostPath
  # the PVC
  dataVolume:
    # Create a PVC called {.Chart.Name}-data when true

    # A path on the host machine to write data into. Also used as the path that the
    # pvc or hostPath will be mounted at so that users need not be confused about
    # inside/outside container paths.

    # This should be a hostPath to the shared data directory for IOCs that
    # need to write to the shared data directory - at DLS this must be
    # /dls/iXX/data (writing data to the host also needs 'pvc: false')
